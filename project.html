                                                            <p>For the final projecct of this module, I decided to make a USB controlled volume adjustment knob. I got some inspiration from the link below in terms of the shape and the basic concept of the controller.</p>
                                                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKxvuphif7A&feature=emb_title">Where I got my idea from.</a>
                                                            <p>I change the design a little by taking out the function in which the controller will pause and play music by pressing the knob once and i also took out the function where pressing the knob twice will move to the next song. Instead I added buttons to the side of the controller so that it can skip to the next song, go back to the previous song and pause and play the music.</p>
                                                            <p>The design of my controller is added below.</p>

                                                        <p>The first thing that I started making the CAD drawing of is the outer case as it will set out the measurements for the rest of the project. Since I want the controller to be portable, I tried to make it as compact as possible, with the diameter of the controller being only a few cm bigger then the length of the arduino board.</p>

                                                        <p>Next, I had to figure out how to keep the buttons and rotary encoder in place.This was done by adding a button holder and adding a removeable base to be put in the centre.</p>
